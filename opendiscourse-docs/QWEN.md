1. Obtain `QWEN_API_KEY` and export in `.env`.
2. Configure LiteLLM routes for `qwen2.*` models.
3. Qwen is strong at coding and long-form generation; evaluate for summarization and data extraction tasks.

**Note:** Verify data residency constraints and caching policies before enabling in production.
