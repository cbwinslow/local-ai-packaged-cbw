# Government Document Crawler

- **Respect robots** and site terms. Use rate limits and supervised allowlists.
- **Identify**: classify gov vs. non-gov with a lightweight model and rules.
- **Extract**: convert PDFs to text; sanitize by rasterizing when needed.
- **Metadata**: nation, jurisdiction, body, session, bill #, sponsors, dates.
- **Provenance**: store fetch URL, hashes, and archive snapshot when allowed.
